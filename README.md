# Pony Chat
Adapted from the TCP Listener example in the Pony language samples. This is my first Pony application and I used it as an experiment to see what it looks like to build an actor-based, multi-user interactive system.

Because I'm old as dirt and still have fond memories of MUDs, I chose to model the networking on text-based, telnet input.
